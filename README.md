# Maze-Generator
Well, generates mazes...

Options given by passing the "--help" argument:		./Maze-Generator --help

To generate a 101x101 labyrinth: ./Maze-Generator --mazeSizeX=101 --mazeSizeY=101

Currently, mazes are only genereted by a recursive method.

Each maze is generated from a seed that can be used to regenerate it.

Some controls to use in the window:
- LControl + Left/Right/Up/Down		to move the view
- LControl + Add/Subtract			to zoom
- S									to show the seed that generated the maze
